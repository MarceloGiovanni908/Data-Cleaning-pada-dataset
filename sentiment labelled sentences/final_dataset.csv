Still SETS got big 10 oy vey scale,
Yes simplifying things sake brevity really core problems film much going without real fulfilling explanation,
good jobs quite amusing,
convoluted plot n convince much film watched weird questioning glance,
let girlfriend talk seeing bad idea hated,
last 15 minutes movie also bad well,
Bela Lugosi totally extraneous intoning odd lines,
acting decidely wooden though worse period Universal B movie,
like Armand Assante cable company summary sounded interesting watched twice already probably,
believe screenwriter good job tying loose ends,
8 10 score mostly plot,
wo n say n like spoilers n want one believe film worth time,
Wow bad film,

death row scenes entirely unmoving,
thing worse Taylor acting Stanwyck singing,
Whatever producer going missed entirely,
deeply impressed character played,
knew saw film great things come gifted actor,
cheap cheerless heist movie poor characterisation lots underbite style stoic emoting think Chow Yun Fat Better Tomorrow cheesy clichÃ©s thrown abandoned factory ready poorly executed flying judo rolls la John Woo,
Even squibs look awful,
point proceedings look remotely like America,
plot derivative predictable ending like mercy killing,
awful dialogue hopeless overacting everyone gets shot top real waste space time,
uneasy bad movie scared,
dialogue composed things make little sense,
30 minutes footage wasted show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo Satanic gibberish corny enough make teen Goth blush almost always Olde English sometimes Latin may may made words,
directing sloppy best,
Hackneyed writing certainly made even worse bad directing,
course acting blah,
acting whole cast could put scale balanced perfectly overacting underacting,
FINALLY get ending would great handled competent people Jerry Falwell,

Rating 10 Grade Z Note Show Bad Even Mother Cast Pull Daughter Show,
20th Century Fox ROAD HOUSE 1948 quite silly noir implausible unmitigated bore movie,
Full unconvincing cardboard characters blandly written Edward Chodorov also produced surprisingly directed Jean Negulesco one would expect great deal,
Widmark character turns unintentionally comical,
losing marbles early proceedings totally implausible unconvincing,
n enough mess movie picture also marred constant use studio sets indoor exteriors,
Whatever prompted documentary beyond,
serious spoilers movie huge disappointment,
many problems dont know start,
cast great,
steve martin delivers really funny performance middle aged upper class uptight white guy,
add betty white jean smart great cast everyone played parts really well,
movie makes lot serious mistakes,
first enough racial stereotypes racial jokes offend everyone,

putting race card aside lets look major flaw film destroy latifa character,
real plot,
wouldnt see movie free,
STEAMBOAT WILLIE amazingly important film cinema history,
second appearance Mickey Mouse following silent PLANE CRAZY earlier year probably famous film mostly ground breaking,
n yet hear Mickey speak tons sound effects music throughout film something take granted huge crowd pleaser 1928,
However seeing short 25 years amazed timeless film actually,
adorable seeing Mickey playing Turkey Straw highly imaginative occasionally cruel way,
Clever real crowd pleaser film still ranks among Mickey best films even 80 wonderful years,
bipolarity ruthless thug one minute ruthless killer next minute Luv diaper commercial completely unconvincing,
terribly disappointed film would receive many awards accolades especially far deserving works film,
original Body Soul 1947 masterpiece,
John Garfield Ann revere Lilli Plmer William Conrad Canada Lee ... filmed one greatest cinematographers ever grace screen .. James Wong Howe,
n think redeeming qualities remake,
may bad film ever made,
bad ... well ... bad,
movie solid example bad plot bad idea way,
shame see good actors like Thomerson James make living mess like,
thought bad,
films terrible credit 1986 version watchable,
Let start problemsÂ—the acting especially lead professor bad,
script big flawed mess,
best example dumb writing established turn zombie students back humans removing necklace containing piece meteorite,
Director Paul Matthews also wrote directed weak 1995 monster movie Grim clearly n know pace films,
movie terribly boring places,
lighting awful,
film looks cheap bland,
One disappointing aspects lack notable gore,
convention never worked well past certainly n work,
visual effects AWFUL,
CG opening sequence space looked like could created Microsoft Slideshow God sake,
explosion Gas tanks end awful,
Okay like consider fair critic give credit credit due creature effects actually pretty cool,
Got ta love close ups slimy drooling teeth,
sum film Breeders terrible cheaply made horror movie avoided like Ebola virus,
recommended,
almost unbearable watch screen little charisma terrible comedic timing,
Aside terrible lead film loads debits,
understand supposed cheap popcorn comedy n mean completely insult intelligence writing incredibly hackneyed borders offensive,
Lewis Black considerable talent wasted incendiary unrestrained PG 13 rating certainly wo n allow,
film sole bright spot Jonah Hill look almost unrecognizable fans recent Superbad due amount weight lost interim,
originality freshness first movie spent remake little else offer,
budget evidently limited,
reflected cast also par script borrowed much earlier classic,
However decent acting action location work balance things,
Filmiing less expansive,
failed convey broad sweep landscapes great part original,
Generally,lacked imagination
recommended,
possible movie get worse,
plot keep going first place,
Even women finally show sign improvement,expected things happen time film might far asleep
Beware trashy cult movie trash period,
ca n believe even sequel,
precisely giving bad review,
90 child truly enjoyed show proudly say enjoyed big time even classical WB cartoons,
Tiny Toons kept 90 vibe delivered one popular funny underrated cartoons ever created,
memories murky say enjoyed every single episode product related show,
Easily none cartoon made laugh tender way getting dark sitcoms oriented teenagers,
characters funny peculiarity true lead character,
Every single character hilarious deserved called lead,
Every element story top excessively phony contrived painful sit,
lines seem WRITTEN fifteen year old though trying oh hard sound like fifteen year old would really um know well ... talk,
Perabo nice energy level obviously comfortable front camera,
simply excuse something poorly done,
saw movie thought stupid movie,
even stupid thought idea volcano Los Angeles,
honest unbelievable nonsense foolish,
conclusion bother movie volcano Los Angeles nothing nonsense,
story line awful,
painful,
accents absolutely abysmal,
also enough hypocrisy film make vomit,
n waste time watching rubbish non researched film,
believe Pitch Black done well,
characters interesting want find longer movie goes think people surprised n make,
Go watch,
Omit watching,
funny,
rating 3 10,
characters interesting really care,
instant classic great soundtrack catchy song ending credits,
n miss,
masterful piece film making many themes simmering occasionally boiling warts study poet bohemian self indulgent wartime years span aerial bombardments London outward tranquillity Welsh coastal retreat borderlines friendship lust love dedication art experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice egotism versus heroism self sacrifice,
mature subtle script suggests occasionally brings dramatic focus underlying tensions well served perfect performances apart odd inappropriate smiling Keira Knightley prone though perhaps direction time characters often mention,
exquisite visual composition moment inventive elegant use close camera angle lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage wonder joy behold,
continuously beautiful look Bertolucci relationships convincing narrative engaging master work,
basic premise wasted since sidelined inexplicable focus documentary crew,
Regardless film fails levels,
Avoid costs,
saw film Christmas great film,
thought Errol Flynn brilliant Custer since become favourite actor,
acting alongside Olivia De Havilland brilliant ending fantastic,
always known Errol Flynn brilliant actor dads favourite actor grew watching films child,
n watched film realised great actually,
give film 10 10,
know Jim Connor energetic nobody could much George well dull,
really n seem want hosting,voice overs monotonous n get involved guests
Lovely little thriller Hitchcock lots nice shenanigans surrounding murdered spy kidnapped child nasty church foreign plot random taxidermists,
Jimmy Stewart ever great hero Hitchcock story rips along cool climax embassy function lacks brooding menace Hitchcock black white low budget original,
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film great master stable,
say film excellently produced tops ratings typical sci fi film,
Excellently produced one Sci fi best producers Scot Vandiver,
entertaining nonetheless,
campy sort film joy watch,
barely boring moment film plenty humorous parts,
cast always entertaining usual,
Overall delight,
movie mind bendingly awful could n even created,
film lacks real scares tension medical terminology used throughout bit iffy say least say insulin dependant diabetic,
least said acting better,
movie excellent job revealing complexity task incredible challenges facing South Africa,
believe every one see movie think people outside South Africa understand past attempted Truth Reconciliation process,
Nothing short magnificent photography cinematography film,
acting fantastic stories seamlessly woven together dogs splendid ............. must rent view see,
n afraid subtitles ........ worth little aversion therapy 10 10,
Excellent performance,
still good actors around,
Also great directing photography,
true Shakespear must Shakespear fans,
Macbeth Jason Connery moved tears final monolog brief candle gave sphere moral decay dark forces human face makes interesting,
Helen Baxendale credible lady Macbeth cheerfull times sometimes looks like naughty girl deadly taste blood evil,
love death decay Shakespears lyrics ... one,
witty delightful adaptation Dr Seuss book brilliantly animated UPA finest thoroughly deserving Academy Award,
Special mention made superb music score sound effects integral element helping make memorable enjoyable cartoon,
However Paul Schrader indeed made film Mishima superb complex,
Also notable John Bailey fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography great production design costumes Eiko Ishioka went memorable costumes Coppola Dracula received well deserved Oscar,
Even allowing poor production values time 1971 format kind mini series baaaaaad,
Unless visually collect extant films Austen work skip one,
watch however small consolations actresses playing Anne sisters wonderful job roles,

Speaking music unbearably predictably kitchy,
film dropped ball,

rare film maker takes time tell worthy moral tale care love n fall trap overly syrupy indulgent,
Nine ten truly lovely film,
early film future goremeister Lucio Fulci good addition giallo sub genre,
one best Italian thrillers early 70,
standout scene,
scene strong unpleasant,
Technically film well made impressive camera work solid acting effective music Riz Ortolani Â– particularly good recurring unaccompanied female vocal sounds like coming distant hill,
still wild stuff though highly recommended fans giallo cinema,
movie interesting beginning end,
liked way Dustin Hoffman character ready everything stay son,
movie also revealing,
Personally think shows people learn find compromise self without involving people issue,
boring,
tired clichÃ©s lazy writing come thick fast,
PS scene movie cool central character finds room blown,
fresh subtle rather sublime effect,
Italian reviewer called small great film right,
actors give wonderful performance especially Jennifer Rubin Jamie Harris changes nervous starlet beginning strange events part cool star,
learn lot real inside emotions people movie lot movie business,
movie movie situations beginning game played acting coach fascinating,
Also music Mark Snow possibly best score ever heard,
wo n forget movie,
film made,

None engaging exciting,
plot nonsense n interest slightest way uniqueness,
Foreigner worth one second time,

want real scare rent one,
10 10,
extraordinary film,
courtroom drama compelling indictment American justice system frightening,
film highlights fundamental flaws legal process discovering guilt innocence rather presents better court,
film well paced understated one best courtroom documentaries seen,
mostly routine fact based TV drama gets boost fine performance Cole,
Predictable bad watch,
clear range ability pull part,
carries movie well,
Constantine gives everything right intensity seems good understanding underlying psychological motivations,
wonderful inspiring watch hope gets released video DVD,
piece trash ever released beyond acting story characters supposedly special effects etc ... wrong,
fact stinker smells like direct video release,
Avoid costs,
Star Trek V final Frontier worst series,
acting involved includes like Shatner Nimoy bad washed making seem old look real life special effects tacky like Spock rescue Kirk jet pack falls mountain,
attempts humor pitiful story awful dose n bear thinking basically involves Vulcan stealing Enterprise find god seriously n care film oh mention Uhura belly dance distract male guards,
place good film garbage,
worst one series,
Editing editing film phenomenal opinion,
song could explain emotions subjects better Jay Adams unfortunate life subject talk song Old Man Neil Young played evokes many emotions,
Cinematography film shot interesting way,
course footage 70s grainy enhanced film,
film offers many delights surprises,
Achille Philippa beautifully sing duet Giovanni perfectly describes situation movie appreciate subtle layers excellent film,
story unfolds 18th century Jutland use period music played period instruments one fine touch,
share General Loewenhielm exquisite joy partaking Cailles en Sarcophage even though watching movie wish small sample savor,
understated film leaves lasting impression,
warmth generates contrast austere backdrop,
leave theater wanting go dance stars,
acting expect cast top notch,
characters fleshed surprisingly well particularly Grimes Blake actors deliver sharply scripted lines right amount deadpan tongue cheek make dialogue hilarious realistic,
Angus Scrimm also turns good performance somewhat brief memorable role gently menacing violin playing anatomist Doctor Quinn,
Conclusion loved,
long time since entertained movie,
struggle find anything bad say,
Mark words one cult films like Evil Dead 2 Phantasm people still discovering falling love 20 30 40 years line,
pretty surprising wonderful film made 1949 Hollywood generally collective heads sand concerning black white issues time,
film deserves strong kudos taking stand exceptional acting mostly lesser known cast super intelligent script n insult audience take easy way comes white racism,

result powerhouse achievement made timely perhaps culture disturbing fascination celebrity distorted interpretations fame,
film easily forgotten,
Kevin Spacey excellent verbal tsunami Buddy Ackerman Â– totally believable great actor,
scripting subtle comedy unmatched movie recent years,
characters interesting even bit predictable,
Highly recommended ages although younger set probably appreciate subtle references certainly appreciate one galley scene particular,
