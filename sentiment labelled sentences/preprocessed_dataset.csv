/10 setting /10,
interesting premise Billy Drago always good dangerous nut-bag side note 'd love see Drago Stephen McHattie Lance Hendrikson flick together,talk raging cheekbones
soundtrack n't terrible either,
acting -- even professionals Drago Debbie Rochon -- terrible directing worse perhaps contributory former dialog chimp-like camera work barely tolerable,
Still SETS got big `` '' 10 '' '' `` '' oy-vey '' '' scale,
Yes simplifying things sake brevity really core problems film much going without real fulfilling explanation,
good jobs quite amusing,
convoluted plot n't convince much film watched weird questioning glance,
let girlfriend talk seeing bad idea hated,
last 15 minutes movie also bad well,
Bela Lugosi totally extraneous intoning odd lines,
acting decidely wooden though worse period Universal B movie,
like Armand Assante cable company 's summary sounded interesting watched twice already probably,
believe screenwriter good job tying loose ends,
8/10 score mostly plot,
wo n't say n't like spoilers n't want one believe film worth time,
Wow bad film,
frightening least barely comprehensible,
plot n't hang together acting absolutely appalling,
even good camp value,
n't expecting Oscar material,
'd IQ particularly stupid mollusk see one coming,
film use word loosely insult movie-going public,
someone involved knew string together narrative,
gets 10 simply 's nothing lower,
one watched recently Fox Movie Channel disappointed,
know contract player little control scripts acting bad script,
Victor McLaglen even bad Brian DonLevy almost unrecognizable,
Considering relations screen Taylor Stanwyck surprising little chemistry screen two,
premise film ridiculous President U.S,
death row scenes entirely unmoving,
thing worse Taylor 's acting Stanwyck 's singing,
Whatever producer going missed entirely,
deeply impressed character played,
knew saw film great things come gifted actor,
cheap cheerless heist movie poor characterisation lots underbite style stoic emoting think Chow Yun Fat Better Tomorrow cheesy clichÃ©s thrown abandoned factory ready poorly executed flying judo rolls la John Woo,
Even squibs look awful,
point proceedings look remotely like America,
plot derivative predictable ending like mercy killing,
awful dialogue hopeless overacting everyone gets shot top real waste space time,
uneasy bad movie scared,
dialogue composed things make little sense,
30 minutes footage wasted show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough make teen Goth blush almost always Olde English sometimes Latin may may made words,
directing sloppy best,
Hackneyed writing certainly made even worse bad directing,
course acting blah,
acting whole cast could put scale balanced perfectly overacting underacting,
FINALLY get ending would 've great handled competent people Jerry Falwell,
loved movie great portrayal family 's share ups end knew special love,
seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith god one best though came 12 years ago,
movie contained all-star cast loved opened eyes see actors n't seen,
movie kind long length enjoyed every minute,
Overall rate movie 10 -10 scale,
Lifetime air enough anyone knows store sells let know must-have,

Duris wholesome appearance gives fine performance,

Cinematography noteworthy including fine views Barcelona famed Gaudi towers,
ten minutes film started second thoughts,
half way film started dislike,
time film ended disliked despised,
film lacks convincing script,
script looks rough draft written shooting began finished script completed,
Things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur real reason script calls,
cast good,
's worth checking,
probably irritating show ever seen entire life,
indescribably annoying idiotic show ever seen,
Everything bad,
could understand kind idiot would produce mess first place mention several season,
script bad bad Â– contains cheesiness unethical joke normally see rated R NC-17 movie,
casting also horrible cause see really really BAD Actors period,
Final Word Show real torture,
zillion times away reality,
Watching washing machine twirling around would n't hurt eyes much show,
Rating /10 Grade Z Note Show Bad Even Mother Cast Pull Daughter Show,
20th Century Fox 's ROAD HOUSE 1948 quite silly noir implausible unmitigated bore movie,
Full unconvincing cardboard characters blandly written Edward Chodorov also produced surprisingly directed Jean Negulesco one would expect great deal,
Widmark character turns unintentionally comical,
losing marbles early proceedings totally implausible unconvincing,
n't enough mess movie picture also marred constant use studio sets indoor exteriors,
Whatever prompted documentary beyond,
serious spoilers movie huge disappointment,
many problems dont know start,
cast great,
steve martin delivers really funny performance middle-aged upper class uptight white guy,
add betty white jean smart great cast everyone played parts really well,
movie makes lot serious mistakes,
first enough racial stereotypes racial jokes offend everyone,
movie littered overt racial slurs towards black cast members return whites depicted morons boobs,
putting race card aside lets look major flaw film destroy latifa 's character,
real plot,
wouldnt see movie free,
STEAMBOAT WILLIE amazingly important film cinema history,
second appearance Mickey Mouse following silent PLANE CRAZY earlier year probably famous film -- mostly ground-breaking,
n't yet hear Mickey speak tons sound effects music throughout film -- something take granted huge crowd pleaser 1928,
However seeing short 25 years amazed timeless film actually,
's adorable seeing Mickey playing `` '' Turkey Straw '' '' highly imaginative occasionally cruel way,
Clever real crowd-pleaser -- film still ranks among Mickey 's best films even 80 wonderful years,
bipolarity ruthless thug one minute ruthless killer next minute Luv 's diaper commercial completely unconvincing,
'm terribly disappointed film would receive many awards accolades especially far deserving works film,
original Body Soul 1947 masterpiece,
John Garfield Ann revere Lilli Plmer William Conrad Canada Lee ... filmed one greatest cinematographers ever grace screen .. James Wong Howe,
n't think redeeming qualities remake,
may bad film ever made,
bad ... well ... 's bad,
movie solid example bad plot bad idea way,
's shame see good actors like Thomerson James make living mess like,
thought bad,
films terrible credit 1986 version watchable,
Let 's start problemsÂ—the acting especially lead professor bad,
script big flawed mess,
best example dumb writing 's established turn zombie-students back humans removing necklace containing piece meteorite,
Director Paul Matthews also wrote/directed weak 1995 monster movie `` '' Grim '' clearly n't know pace films,
movie terribly boring places,
lighting awful,
film looks cheap bland,
One disappointing aspects lack notable gore,
convention never worked well past certainly n't work,
visual effects AWFUL,
CG opening sequence space looked like could created Microsoft Slideshow God 's sake,
`` explosion '' Gas tanks end awful,
Okay like consider fair critic 'll give credit credit 's due -- creature effects actually pretty cool,
Got ta love close-ups slimy drooling teeth,
sum film '' Breeders '' '' terrible cheaply made horror movie avoided like Ebola virus,
recommended,
almost unbearable watch screen little charisma terrible comedic timing,
Aside 's terrible lead film loads debits,
understand 's supposed cheap popcorn comedy n't mean completely insult intelligence writing incredibly hackneyed borders offensive,
Lewis Black 's considerable talent wasted incendiary unrestrained PG-13 rating certainly wo n't allow,
film 's sole bright spot Jonah Hill look almost unrecognizable fans recent Superbad due amount weight lost interim,
originality freshness first movie spent remake little else offer,
budget evidently limited,
reflected cast also below-par script borrowed much earlier classic,
However decent acting action location work balance things,
Filmiing less expansive,
failed convey broad sweep landscapes great part original,
Generally,lacked imagination
recommended,
possible movie get worse,
plot keep going first place,
Even women finally show sign improvement,expected things happen time film might far asleep
Beware trashy cult movie trash -period,
ca n't believe 's even sequel,
precisely giving bad review,
90 's child truly enjoyed show proudly say enjoyed big time even classical WB cartoons,
`` '' Tiny Toons '' '' kept 90 's vibe delivered one popular funny underrated cartoons ever created,
memories murky say enjoyed every single episode product related show,
Easily none cartoon made laugh tender way getting dark sitcoms oriented teenagers,
characters funny peculiarity true lead character,
Every single character hilarious deserved called lead,
Every element story top excessively phony contrived painful sit,
lines seem WRITTEN fifteen year old though trying oh hard sound like fifteen year old would really um know well ... talk,
Perabo nice energy level obviously comfortable front camera,
simply excuse something poorly done,
saw movie thought stupid movie,
even stupid thought idea volcano Los Angeles,
honest unbelievable nonsense foolish,
conclusion bother movie volcano Los Angeles nothing nonsense,
story line awful,
's painful,
accents absolutely abysmal,
's also enough hypocrisy film make vomit,
n't waste time watching rubbish non-researched film,
believe Pitch Black done well,
characters interesting want find longer movie goes think people surprised n't make,
Go watch,
Omit watching,
funny,
rating 3 10,
characters interesting really care,
instant classic great soundtrack catchy song ending credits,
n't miss,
masterful piece film-making many themes simmering occasionally boiling warts study poet 's bohemian self-indulgent wartime years span aerial bombardments London outward tranquillity Welsh coastal retreat borderlines friendship lust love dedication art experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice egotism versus heroism self-sacrifice,
mature subtle script suggests occasionally brings dramatic focus underlying tensions well served perfect performances apart odd inappropriate smiling Keira Knightley prone though perhaps direction time characters often mention,
exquisite visual composition moment inventive elegant use close-up camera angle lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage wonder joy behold,
's continuously beautiful look Bertolucci relationships convincing narrative engaging master 's work,
basic premise wasted since sidelined inexplicable focus documentary crew,
Regardless film fails levels,
Avoid costs,
saw film Christmas great film,
thought Errol Flynn brilliant Custer since become favourite actor,
acting alongside Olivia De Havilland brilliant ending fantastic,
always known Errol Flynn brilliant actor dads favourite actor grew watching films child,
n't watched film realised great actually,
'll give film 10 10,
know Jim O'Connor energetic nobody could much George well dull,
really n't seem want hosting,voice-overs monotonous n't get involved guests
Lovely little thriller Hitchcock lots nice shenanigans surrounding murdered spy kidnapped child nasty church foreign plot random taxidermists,
Jimmy Stewart ever great hero Hitchcock story rips along cool climax embassy function lacks brooding menace Hitchcock 's black white low-budget original,
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film great master 's stable,
say film excellently produced tops ratings typical sci fi film,
Excellently produced one Sci-fi 's best producers Scot Vandiver,
entertaining nonetheless,
's campy sort film 's joy watch,
's barely boring moment film plenty humorous parts,
cast always entertaining usual,
Overall delight,
movie mind-bendingly awful could n't even created,
film lacks real scares tension medical terminology used throughout bit iffy say least say insulin dependant diabetic,
least said acting better,
movie excellent job revealing complexity task incredible challenges facing South Africa,
believe every one see movie think people outside South Africa understand past attempted Truth Reconciliation process,
Nothing short magnificent photography/cinematography film,
acting fantastic stories seamlessly woven together dogs splendid ............. must rent view see,
n't afraid subtitles ........ worth little aversion therapy 10/10,
Excellent performance,
still good actors around,

earth Irons film,
saw film recommend,
good plot holds complete attention acting superb Tom Wilkinson fantastic Emily Watson also good,
good film indeed great unconditional love,
Tom Wilkinson 's character man prepared ordeal begin takes matter hand story progresses great actor gives performance makes feel character 's anguish suffering,
Emily Watson 's character strong give quick glance understand everything,
Despite pans reviewers liked movie,
fact liked better Interview Vampire liked Lestat Stuart Townsend better Cruise 's attempt,
Aailiyah pretty good Akasha places compelling first entrance mini dance scene,
'm big fan series mostly due Anne Rice 's style sensitivities treatments,
guess liked details dysfunction -- believable,
football scenes end perplexing,
thought acting skilled,
Meredith better right,
charming film wonderful sentiment heart,
rare film-maker takes time tell worthy moral tale care love n't fall trap overly syrupy indulgent,
Nine ten truly lovely film,
early film future goremeister Lucio Fulci good addition giallo sub-genre,
one best Italian thrillers early 70 's,
standout scene,
scene strong unpleasant,
Technically film well made impressive camera-work solid acting effective music Riz Ortolani Â– particularly good recurring unaccompanied female vocal sounds like 's coming distant hill,
's still wild stuff though highly recommended fans giallo cinema,
movie interesting beginning end,
liked way Dustin Hoffman 's character ready everything stay son,
movie also revealing,
Personally think shows people learn find compromise self without involving people issue,
boring,
tired clichÃ©s lazy writing come thick fast,
PS scene movie cool central character finds room blown,
's fresh subtle rather sublime effect,
Italian reviewer called `` '' small great film '' '' 's right,
actors give wonderful performance especially Jennifer Rubin Jamie Harris changes nervous starlet beginning strange events part cool star,
learn lot real inside emotions people movie lot movie business,
movie movie situations beginning game played `` '' acting coach '' '' fascinating,
Also music Mark Snow possibly best score 've ever heard,
wo n't forget movie,
film made,
film ultra-cheap look,
result film n't look right,
None engaging exciting,
plot nonsense n't interest slightest way uniqueness,
Foreigner worth one second time,
saw child TV back 1973 `` '' Stranger '' '' loved,
duet astronaut doctor beginning movie perfect exchange one considers movie made well Cold War astronaut 's biggest fear crashed USSR,
movie awesome,
loved really scary,
love Scream movies horror movies one ranks way,
want real scare rent one,
10/10,
extraordinary film,
courtroom drama 's compelling indictment American justice system 's frightening,
film highlights fundamental flaws legal process 's discovering guilt innocence rather presents better court,
film well paced understated one best courtroom documentaries 've seen,
mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets boost fine performance Cole,
Predictable bad watch,
clear range ability pull part,
carries movie well,
Constantine gives everything right intensity seems good understanding underlying psychological motivations,
wonderful inspiring watch hope gets released video DVD,
piece trash ever released beyond acting story characters supposedly special effects etc ... 's wrong,
fact stinker smells like direct-to-video release,
Avoid costs,
Star Trek V final Frontier worst series,
acting involved includes like Shatner Nimoy bad washed making seem old look real life special effects tacky like Spock rescue Kirk jet pack falls mountain,
attempts humor pitiful story awful dose n't bear thinking basically involves Vulcan stealing Enterprise find god seriously n't care film oh mention Uhura belly dance distract male guards,
place good film garbage,
worst one series,
Editing editing film phenomenal opinion,
song could explain emotions subjects better Jay Adams unfortunate life subject talk song Old Man Neil Young played evokes many emotions,
Cinematography film shot interesting way,
course footage 70s grainy enhanced film,
film offers many delights surprises,
Achille Philippa beautifully sing duet `` '' Giovanni '' '' perfectly describes situation movie appreciate subtle layers excellent film,
story unfolds 18th century Jutland use period music played period instruments one fine touch,
share General Loewenhielm 's exquisite joy partaking Cailles en Sarcophage even though watching movie wish small sample savor,
understated film leaves lasting impression,
warmth generates contrast austere backdrop,
leave theater wanting go dance stars,
acting 'd expect cast top notch,
characters fleshed surprisingly well particularly Grimes Blake actors deliver sharply scripted lines right amount deadpan tongue cheek make dialogue hilarious realistic,
Angus Scrimm also turns good performance somewhat brief memorable role gently menacing violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn,
Conclusion loved,
's long time since entertained movie,
struggle find anything bad say,
Mark words one cult films like Evil Dead 2 Phantasm people still discovering falling love 20 30 40 years line,
's pretty surprising wonderful film made 1949 Hollywood generally collective heads sand concerning black white issues time,
film deserves strong kudos taking stand exceptional acting mostly lesser-known cast super-intelligent script n't insult audience take easy way comes white racism,
Plus movie 's rather modest budget fast running time amazing job,
Juano Hernandez exceptional actor played supporting roles many films era proud black man accused murdering white man South,
Trumbull LOVE LUCY,
See kids chance -- open amazing dialog far race relations come last 50 years,
See films,
year however reminded us Huston still top game evinced faithful adaptation James Joyce 's acclaimed novella `` '' Dead,
Feelings thoughts ... Gabriel 's discomfort dance ... intangibles leap life come within viewer 's grasp Huston 's portrayal,
disappointed wondered could Oscar shortlist,
's slow,
Lot holes plot 's nothing became emperor,nothing spend 20 years childhood mature age
n't waste time,
End Days one worst big-budget action movies 've ever seen,
surely n't know make coherent action movie screenwriter Air Force One obliged write script big sum money,
one worst films ever seen,
'm still trying get bad,
movie possibly one creative works horror ever,
everything could want ... suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating ... 're looking be-all end-all brainsucking movies look,
great sound effects impressive special effects ca n't recommend movie enough,
Call nut think one best movies ever,
Great character actors Telly Savalas Peter Boyle,
hour 54 minutes sheer tedium melodrama horrible acting mess script sinking feeling GOOD LORD THINKING,
Lots holes script,
's like bad two hour TV movie,
imagine every single one decisions made wrong,
dialogue atrocious,
acting beyond abysmal,
Everything stinks,
Trouble writing directing make impossible establish things make movie watchable like character story theme,
Worse 's incredibly weak sub-plot thrown follows little band latter-day Mansonites go reporter 's working story anniversary killings,
's dumb pointless complete waste time,
short n't bother movie,
wo n't spoil ending pretty amazing,
best scene movie end wo n't spoil,
ever indication writer director 's ability meld two highly volatile temperaments seamless union creativity,
result powerhouse achievement made timely perhaps culture 's disturbing fascination celebrity 's distorted interpretations fame,
film easily forgotten,
Kevin Spacey excellent verbal tsunami Buddy Ackerman Â– totally believable great actor,
scripting subtle comedy unmatched movie recent years,
characters interesting even bit predictable,
Highly recommended ages although younger set probably appreciate subtle references certainly appreciate one galley scene particular,
Great movie,
Also story acting weak,
around 4 pm bought around 8pm started watch around 8.15pm fast forwarded remaining film see anything left watchable human brain ... n't,
Either way sucks,
script horrendously stupid,
story starts fast absolutely suspense build-up slightest,
Everything Captain Howdy says either laughable plain stupid,
hell kind crap,
's plot holes,
could drive semi truck holes,
Linda Cardellini thing good film,
's poised amazing,
Dee Snider plain sucks,
ca n't act one least scary villains ever seen ca n't write write damn movie sleep,
bored throughout whole damn thing,
acting sucks music sucks script sucks pacing sucks special FX suck directing sucks ... basically movie sucks,
film tries serious sophisticated thriller/horror flick fails miserably,
probably one least effective utterly unoriginal films ever seen entire life,
piece cinematic garbage captured celluloid,
Avoid costs,
rate film stinks funny Fulci stayed giallo supernatural zombie movies,
Avoid film costs,
n't know happened Season Five mess,
consistent thread holding series together amazing performances Leni Parker Anita LaSelva two Taelons quiet idealogical conflict,
movie really dislike,
's one boring Horror movies 90 's mainly starts slow centers boring atmosphere,
puppets look really cheesy good way like Puppet Master 80 's flicks,
story lame interesting NEVER really explains sinister origins puppets,
n't death scenes like previous movies f/x terrible,
felt asleep first time watched recommend insomniacs,
fact film wonderful heartwarming tale two people chasing dreams,
best part `` '' Nurse Betty '' '' 's unpredictability,
Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence seperate dreams reality along touching drama hilarious comedy never tell going happen next,
Otherwise n't even waste time,
one fails create real suspense,
killer n't expect anything original even remotely frightening,
however pretty good acting least type film,
'm sorry really ca n't recommend anyone,
One boring pointless movies ever seen,
secondary plot line incomprehensible relation primary plot line mystifying,
Hated,
one worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 quite bad,
n't understand garbage got shelves movie store 's even real movie,
highly doubt anyone could ever like trash,
movie-making,
acting like watching wooden puppets moving around reading book 's bad,
warn -- RENT MOVIE dumbest thing never seen,
saw short film HBO day absolutely loved,
n't realize wonderful short really last two scenes,
Excellent short film,
Hopefully director James Cox turn short feature length film cast win us whole new film,
agree Jessica movie pretty bad,
Characters one-dimensional even good guys especially bad guys,
story line totally predictable,
much dialogue much music whole film shot elaborately aesthetically like sculpture,
've seen soap operas intelligent movie,
Bad characters bad story bad acting,
Really awful,
easy watch,
Funny clever hip like Pray 's previous film Hype,
long time n't see charismatic actor screen,
Paolo Sorrentino written wonderful story loneliness Tony built one unforgettable characters seen movies recent years,
movie completely perfect 'Titta Di Girolamo stay long time vision movie,
rate movie 9/10,
know Emilio Estevez 's directorial debut pacing interplay development characters well clever camera work surrounding character Estevez plays suggest natural eye,
interplay Martin Emilio contains wonderful chemistry saw Wall Street Martin Charlie,
Kathy Bates wonderful characters subtle desperation escapism,variation character `` '' Play Fields Lord '' ''
readers already seen one Miyazaki 's films still top form made another worthwhile experience,
never condescends characters good genuine hearts believable problems,
two main characters may two believable children ever saw put screen,
easy love even easy identify,
movie great -- especially enjoy visual arts,
scenery two daughters paint photograph beautiful,
story also funny poignant times,
People like European films `` '' art movies '' '' like movie,
truly art movie -- actually lot art,
Go rent,
However finally watching film realized closed mind brilliance depicts also found watching,
's one movie never ceases interest simply keeps alert try attempt decipher 's meanings,
Brilliance indeed,
liked movies like Matrix better yet sequels think 'll appreciate thought provoking mindblowing experience film give,
Think film like dream,
Simply beautiful,
Rickman Stowe play roles hilt tale childrens book writer -- maybe -- written subversive tract,
's gloriously fun fast paced fairly accurate portrayal night raver,
presents idyllic yet serious portrayal ups downs characters lives,
whatever avoid `` '' Groove '' '' antithesis good Human Traffic,
's bad everyone else involved n't share Crowe 's level dedication quality 'd far better film hands sub-par mess,
movie seemed little slow first,
picked speed got right point,
showed exactly government scientist argued humanity reasons `` '' gadget '' '',
enjoyed,
recommended friends,
particularly pleased acting ability Dwight Schultz,
actors truly understand become particular character delivering convincing sincere performance,
on-screen chemistry critical entire film genuine,
film 's dialogue natural real life,
writer Gorman Bechard undoubtedly homework references industry character-age appropriate,
incredible soundtrack truly captures essence film,
track commands sentiment actually contributing scenes characters,
Definitely worth seeingÂ… 's sort thought provoking film forces question threshold loneliness,
Hayao Miyazaki 's latest eighth film Studio Ghibili `` '' Gake Ue Ponyo '' '' Ponyo Cliff Sea wonderfully fun imaginative look childhood,
time seems film animation dominated Disney/Pixar 's CGI masterpieces refreshing comforting know Miyazaki still relying traditional hand-drawn animation tell charming enchanting stories,
Enough said remarkable animation film,
art style appearance crayon/pencil drawings wonderfully colorful fanciful,
act film glad 're gon na drift away earth far possible,
one wants surf small wave space movies 1998 Deep Impact Armageddon one fails everywhere,
n't choked vomit end cheap drama worthless dialogue 've must bored death waste time,
Still makes super ending depicts great sea vessel taken mighty frost,
consider excellent story solid acting look film added bonuses,
Instead got bore fest whiny spoiled brat babysitting,
